# Platform ApplicationSet - Currently Empty

Since ArgoCD is already installed via Helm, the platform ApplicationSet is currently empty.

Future platform services can be added here:
- Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Security tools
- CI/CD tools (Jenkins, Tekton, etc.)
- Service mesh (Istio, Linkerd)

For now, we'll focus on the infrastructure ApplicationSet for the core components.
